# RockPaperScissors

creating a game of rock paper scissors against an AI, using js and html and eventually adding css and buttons to make the game feel and look and play a lot nicer.

Task - give user choice to pick rock paper or scissors, the ai will randomly be assigned a one of the 3 choices. Rock beats scissors, paper beats roc and scissors beats paper. game ends when user or ai score reaches 5.

subtasks
1. create user prompt to pick rock, paper or scissors, display in console to ensure correct class has been chosen.
2. create ai generator that randomly picks 1 of the 3 classes, display in console
3. create system/function that makes it so the correct classes beat one another
4. join all 3 subtasks under one main loop or repeat until score of ai or player reaches 5
5. :/
