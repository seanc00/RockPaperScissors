# Rock Paper Scissors

Creating a game of Rock Paper Scissors against an AI, using JavaScript and HTML, and eventually adding CSS and buttons to improve the game's look, feel, and playability.

## Task
- Give the user the choice to pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The AI will be randomly assigned one of the three choices.
- Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beats Paper.
- The game ends when either the user or AI reaches a score of 5.

## Subtasks
1. **Create User Prompt:** 
   - Allow the user to pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors and display their choice in the console to ensure the correct option has been chosen.
   
2. **AI Choice Generator:** 
   - Create a function that randomly selects one of the three options for the AI, and display the AI's choice in the console.
   
3. **Game Logic:**
   - Implement a system or function to compare the user’s and AI’s choices to determine which class wins (Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper).
   
4. **Main Game Loop:**
   - Combine all three subtasks under one main loop that repeats until either the AI or player reaches a score of 5.
